## B. Student and School Effects on Students' Reading Scores

1.  Stepwise model development plan:
    -   Start with a basic model including only student background variables and reading score.
    -   Add home ICT variables to the model.
    -   Incorporate school background variables into the model.
    -   Evaluate and modify the model to improve fit and interpretability.
