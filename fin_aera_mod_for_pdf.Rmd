## B. Student and School Effects on Students' Reading Scores
1. Stepwise model development plan:
    - Start with a basic model including only student background variables and reading score. 
    - Add home ICT variables to the model.
    - Incorporate school background variables into the model. 
    - Evaluate and modify the model to improve fit and interpretability.
